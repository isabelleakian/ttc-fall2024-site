                    <p>
                        The Clubhouse Network hosts Teen Summits every two years across the globe. Teen Summits are gatherings where young people come together to work on projects, participate in workshops, and build community. This year, Grand St. Settlement had the honor of hosting our region's Teen Summit in New York City. We welcomed 15 Clubhouses and Best Buy Teen Tech Centers to participate in a two-day film challenge.
